==Title and subject==
{{Main|Lisa del Giocondo}}

The title of the painting, which is known in English as ''Mona Lisa'', comes from a description by [[Renaissance]] art historian [[Giorgio Vasari]], who wrote "Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife."<ref name=Vasari>{{Lang-it|Prese Lionardo a fare per Francesco del Giocondo il ritratto di mona Lisa sua moglie}}{{harvnb|Vasari|1879|p=39}}</ref><ref name="Clark">{{cite journal|author=Clark, Kenneth|title=Mona Lisa|journal=[[The Burlington Magazine]]|edition=vol 115|issue=840|date=March 1973|issn=0007-6287|volume=115|ref=harv|jstor=877242|pages=144–151}}</ref> ''Mona'' in Italian is a polite form of address originating as "ma donna" – similar to "Ma’am", "Madam", or "[[my lady]]" in English. This became "[[Madonna (art)|madonna]]", and its contraction "mona". The title of the painting, though traditionally spelled "Mona" (as used by Vasari<ref name=Vasari/>), is also commonly spelled in modern Italian as ''Monna Lisa'' ("[[Wikt:mona#Italian|mona]]" being a vulgarity in some Italian dialects) but this is rare in English.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The fate of the painting around Leonardo’s death and just after it has divided academic opinion. Some, such as [[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Kemp]], believe that upon Leonardo’s death, the painting was inherited with other works by his pupil and assistant [[Salaì]] and was still in the latter’s possession in 1525.<ref name="Kemp">{{harvnb|Kemp|2006|pp=261–262}}</ref><ref name="Kemp Pallanti">{{cite book |last1=Kemp |first1=Martin| last2=Pallanti|first2=Giuseppe|date=2017|title=Mona Lisa: The people and the painting |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198749905}}</ref> Others believe that the painting was sold to Francis I by [[Salaì]], together with ''[[The Virgin and Child with St. Anne]]'' and the ''St. John the Baptist'' in 1518.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jestaz|first=Bertrand |year= 1999 |title=Francois 1er, Salai, et les tableaux de Léonard|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/rvart_0035-1326_1999_num_126_1_348476 |journal= Revue de l’Art |volume=76|pages=68–72 |access-date= August 3, 2017}}</ref> The Louvre Museum lists the painting as having entered the Royal collection in 1518.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mona-lisa-portrait-lisa-gherardini-wife-francesco-del-giocondo|last=Louvre Museum|title=Mona Lisa|website=www.louvre.fr|access-date= August 3, 2017}}</ref>

Given the issue surrounding the dating of the painting, the presence of the flanking columns in the Raphael sketch, the uncertainty concerning the person who commissioned it and its fate around the time of Leonardo’s death, a number of experts have argued that Leonardo painted two versions of the Mona Lisa.<ref name=Isbouts/><ref name="Lorusso Natali"/><ref name=Boudin>{{cite book |last=Boudin de l'Arche|first=Gerard|date=2017 |title=A la recherche de Monna Lisa |location=Cannes, France |publisher=Edition de l'Omnibus |isbn=9791095833017}}</ref> The first would have been commissioned by Francesco del Giocondo circa 1503, had flanking columns, have been left unfinished and have been in Salai’s possession in 1525.

The painting was kept at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]], where it remained until [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] moved the painting to the [[Palace of Versailles]]. After the [[French Revolution]], it was moved to the [[Louvre]], but spent a brief period in the bedroom of [[Napoleon]] in the [[Tuileries Palace]].

During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–71) it was moved from the Louvre to the [[Brest Arsenal]].<ref name="Bohm-Duchen2001p53">{{cite book

The woman sits markedly upright in a "pozzetto" armchair with her arms folded, a sign of her reserved posture. Her gaze is fixed on the observer.

The soft blending creates an ambiguous mood "mainly in two features: the corners of the mouth, and the corners of the eyes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artchive.com/artchive/L/leonardo/monalisa_text.jpg.html |title=E.H.

There has been much speculation regarding the painting's model and landscape. For example, Leonardo probably painted his model faithfully since her beauty is not seen as being among the best, "even when measured by late quattrocento (15th century) or even twenty-first century standards."<ref>Irene Earls, ''Artists of the Renaissance'', Greenwood Press, 2004, p.113. {{ISBN|0-313-31937-5}}</ref> Some art historians in Eastern art, such as [[Yukio Yashiro]], argue that the landscape in the background of the picture was influenced by [[Chinese paintings]],<ref name=Salgueiro/> but this thesis has been contested for lack of clear evidence.<ref name=Salgueiro>{{cite book|first=Heliana Angotti |last=Salgueiro|title=Paisaje y art|publisher=[[University of São Paulo]]|year= 2000|page= 74|isbn=85-901430-1-5}}</ref>

Research in 2003 by Professor [[Margaret Livingstone]] of [[Harvard University]] said that Mona Lisa's smile disappears when observed with direct vision, known as [[foveal]]. Because of the way the human eye processes visual information, it is less suited to pick up shadows directly; however, [[peripheral vision]] can pick up shadows well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2775817.stm |title=BBC NEWS – Entertainment – Mona Lisa smile secrets revealed |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831010359/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2775817.stm |archivedate=31 August 2007 }}</ref>

Research in 2008 by a geomorphology professor at [[Urbino University]] and an artist-photographer revealed likenesses of ''Mona Lisa''{{`}}s landscapes to some views in the [[Montefeltro]] region in the Italian provinces of [[Pesaro]], [[Urbino]] and [[Rimini]].<ref>Rosetta Borchia and Olivia Nesci, ''Codice P.

==Conservation==
The ''Mona Lisa'' has survived for more than 500 years, and an international commission convened in 1952 noted that "the picture is in a remarkable state of preservation."<ref name="mohen">{{cite book | last = Mohen | first = Jean-Pierre | title = Mona Lisa: inside the Painting | publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.]] | year = 2006 | page=128|isbn = 0-8109-4315-8 }}</ref> This is partly due to a variety of conservation treatments the painting has undergone. A detailed analysis in 1933 by Madame de Gironde revealed that earlier restorers had "acted with a great deal of restraint."<ref name="mohen" /> Nevertheless, applications of [[varnish]] made to the painting had darkened even by the end of the 16th century, and an aggressive 1809 cleaning and revarnishing removed some of the uppermost portion of the paint layer, resulting in a washed-out appearance to the face of the figure. Despite the treatments, the ''Mona Lisa'' has been well cared for throughout its history, and although the panel's warping caused the curators "some worry",<ref>{{cite news|title=Ageing Mona Lisa worries Louvre |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3660143.stm |date=26 April 2004 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=24 October 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816062240/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3660143.stm |archivedate=16 August 2009 }}</ref> the 2004–05 conservation team was optimistic about the future of the work.<ref name="mohen" />

===Poplar panel===
At some point, the ''Mona Lisa'' was removed from its original frame. The unconstrained poplar panel warped freely with changes in humidity, and as a result, a crack developed near the top of the panel, extending down to the hairline of the figure. In the mid-18th century to early 19th century, two butterfly-shaped walnut braces were inserted into the back of the panel to a depth of about one third the thickness of the panel. This intervention was skilfully executed, and successfully stabilized the crack. Sometime between 1888 and 1905, or perhaps during the picture's theft, the upper brace fell out. A later restorer glued and lined the resulting socket and crack with cloth.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The picture is kept under strict, climate-controlled conditions in its bulletproof glass case. The humidity is maintained at 50%&nbsp;±10%, and the temperature is maintained between 18 and 21&nbsp;°C. To compensate for fluctuations in relative humidity, the case is supplemented with a bed of [[silica gel]] treated to provide 55% relative humidity.<ref name="mohen" />

===Frame===
Because the ''Mona Lisa''{{'}}s poplar support expands and contracts with changes in humidity, the picture has experienced some warping. In response to warping and swelling experienced during its storage during World War II, and to prepare the picture for an exhibit to honour the anniversary of Leonardo's 500th birthday, the ''Mona Lisa'' was fitted in 1951 with a flexible oak frame with beech crosspieces. This flexible frame, which is used in addition to the decorative frame described below, exerts pressure on the panel to keep it from warping further. In 1970, the beech [[cross brace|crosspieces]] were switched to maple after it was found that the [[beechwood]] had been infested with insects. In 2004–05, a conservation and study team replaced the maple crosspieces with sycamore ones, and an additional metal crosspiece was added for scientific measurement of the panel's warp.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The ''Mona Lisa'' has had many different decorative frames in its history, owing to changes in taste over the centuries. In 1909, the [[Martine-Marie-Pol de Béhague|Comtesse de Béhague]] gave the portrait its current frame,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastellists.com/Collectors.htm |title=Biographical index of collectors of pastels |publisher=Pastellists.com |date= |accessdate=3 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615060320/http://www.pastellists.com/Collectors.htm |archivedate=15 June 2013 }}</ref> a Renaissance-era work consistent with the historical period of the ''Mona Lisa''. The edges of the painting have been trimmed at least once in its history to fit the picture into various frames, but no part of the original paint layer has been trimmed.<ref name="mohen" />

===Cleaning and touch-up===
The first and most extensive recorded cleaning, revarnishing, and touch-up of the ''Mona Lisa'' was an 1809 wash and revarnishing undertaken by Jean-Marie Hooghstoel, who was responsible for restoration of paintings for the galleries of the [[Musée Napoléon]]. The work involved cleaning with spirits, touch-up of colour, and revarnishing the painting. In 1906, Louvre restorer Eugène Denizard performed watercolour retouches on areas of the paint layer disturbed by the crack in the panel. Denizard also retouched the edges of the picture with varnish, to mask areas that had been covered initially by an older frame. In 1913, when the painting was recovered after its theft, Denizard was again called upon to work on the ''Mona Lisa''. Denizard was directed to clean the picture without [[solvent]], and to lightly touch up several scratches to the painting with watercolour. In 1952, the varnish layer over the background in the painting was evened out. After the second 1956 attack, restorer Jean-Gabriel Goulinat was directed to touch up the damage to ''Mona Lisa''{{'}}s left elbow with watercolour.<ref name="mohen" />

In 1977, a new insect infestation was discovered in the back of the panel as a result of crosspieces installed to keep the painting from warping. This was treated on the spot with [[carbon tetrachloride]], and later with an [[ethylene oxide]] treatment. In 1985, the spot was again treated with carbon tetrachloride as a preventive measure.<ref name="mohen" />

Once part of [[King Francis I of France]]'s collection, the ''Mona Lisa'' was among the very first artworks to be exhibited in Louvre, which became a national museum after the French Revolution. From the 19th century Leonardo began to be revered as a genius and the painting's popularity grew from the mid-19th century when French intelligentsia developed a theme that it was somehow mysterious and a representation of the [[femme fatal]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sassoon |first=Donald |title=Why is the Mona Lisa Famous? |url=http://podcast.blogs.latrobe.edu.au/2014/01/21/26-why-is-the-mona-lisa-famous/ |publisher=La Trobe University Podcast |accessdate=20 January 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704044849/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/marketing/assets/podcasts/2008/opinion-nov2808-audio.mp3 |archivedate=4 July 2015 }}</ref>

[[Raphael]], who had been to Leonardo's workshop several times, promptly used elements of the portrait's composition and format in several of his works, such as ''[[Young Woman with Unicorn]]'' (c.&nbsp;1506<ref>Zollner gives a date of c. 1504, most others say c. 1506</ref>), and ''[[Portrait of Maddalena Doni]]'' (c.&nbsp;1506).  Celebrated later paintings by Raphael, ''[[La velata]]'' (1515–16) and ''[[Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione]]'' (c.&nbsp;1514–15), continued to borrow from Leonardo's painting. Zollner states that "None of Leonardo's works would exert more influence upon the evolution of the genre than the ''Mona Lisa''.  It became the definitive example of the Renaissance portrait and perhaps for this reason is seen not just as the likeness of a real person, but also as the embodiment of an ideal."<ref>{{cite book|page=161|title=Leonardo Da Vinci, 1452–1519|authorlink=Frank Zöllner|last=Zöllner|first=Frank}}</ref>

Early commentators such as [[Vasari]] and [[André Félibien]] praised the picture for its [[Realism (arts)|realism]], but by the Victorian era writers began to regard the ''Mona Lisa'' as imbued with a sense of mystery and [[Romanticism|romance]].  In 1859 [[Théophile Gautier]] wrote that the ''Mona Lisa'' was a "sphinx of beauty who smiles so mysteriously" and that "Beneath the form expressed one feels a thought that is vague, infinite, inexpressible. One is moved, troubled ... repressed desires, hopes that drive one to despair, stir painfully."  [[Walter Pater]]'s famous essay of 1869 described the sitter as "older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in the deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mCBiu2yFUgC&pg=PA214|title=Leonardo Da Vinci, Selected Scholarship: Leonardo's projects, c. 1500–1519|chapter=Mona Lisa|author=Clark, Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Clark|editor=Farago, Claire J.|page=214|isbn=9780815329350|year=1999}}</ref>  By the early 20th&nbsp;century some critics started to feel the painting had become a repository for subjective exegeses and theories,<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/mar/28/londonreviewofbooks |work=The Guardian |title=The myth of the Mona Lisa |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710090649/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/mar/28/londonreviewofbooks |archivedate=10 July 2017 }}</ref> and upon the painting's theft in 1911, Renaissance historian [[Bernard Berenson]] admitted that it had "simply become an incubus, and I was glad to be rid of her."<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fzdlbNBUsJsC&pg=PA215|page=215|title=Bernard Berenson, the Making of a Legend|isbn=9780674067790|author1=Samuels|first1=Ernest|last2=Samuels|first2=Jayne|year=1987}}</ref>

The [[avant-garde]] art world has made note of the undeniable fact of the ''Mona Lisa''{{'}}s popularity. Because of the painting's overwhelming stature, [[Dada]]ists and [[surrealism|Surrealists]] often produce modifications and [[caricature]]s. Already in 1883, ''Le rire,'' an image of a Mona Lisa smoking a pipe, by [[Sapeck]] (Eugène Bataille), was shown at the "[[Incoherents]]" show in Paris. In 1919, [[Marcel Duchamp]], one of the most influential modern artists, created ''[[L.H.O.O.Q.]]'', a ''Mona Lisa'' parody made by adorning a cheap reproduction with a moustache and goatee. Duchamp added an inscription, which when read out loud in French sounds like "Elle a chaud au cul" meaning: "she has a hot ass", implying the woman in the painting is in a state of sexual excitement and intended as a [[Humor in Freud|Freudian joke]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones |first=Jonathan |title=L.H.O.O.Q., Marcel Duchamp (1919) |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=26 May 2001 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/may/26/art |accessdate=12 June 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509202948/http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/may/26/art |archivedate=9 May 2014 }}</ref> According to [[Rhonda Roland Shearer|Rhonda R.

===''Prado Museum La Gioconda''===
{{main|Mona Lisa (Prado's version)}}

A version of ''Mona Lisa'' known as ''Mujer de mano de Leonardo Abince'' ("Leonardo da Vinci's handy-woman") held in Madrid's [[Museo del Prado]] was for centuries considered to be a work by Leonardo. However, since its restoration in 2012 it is considered to have been executed by one of [[Leonardeschi|Leonardo's pupils]] in his studio at the same time as ''Mona Lisa'' was being painted.<ref>{{cite web|title=La Gioconda, Leonardo's atelier |url=https://www.museodelprado.es/en/exhibitions/exhibitions/at-the-museum/instalacion-temporal-de-la-gioconda-copia/la-gioconda-del-museo-nacional-del-prado/ |website=Museo Nacional del Prado |accessdate=7 December 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208204026/https://www.museodelprado.es/en/exhibitions/exhibitions/at-the-museum/instalacion-temporal-de-la-gioconda-copia/la-gioconda-del-museo-nacional-del-prado/ |archivedate=8 December 2015 }}</ref> Their conclusion, based on analysis obtained after the picture underwent extensive restoration, that the painting is probably by [[Salaì]] (1480–1524) or by [[Francesco Melzi|Melzi]] (1493–1572). This has been called into question by others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://monalisa.org/2012/09/11/prado/ |title=The 'Prado Mona Lisa' – The Mona Lisa Foundation |work=The Mona Lisa Foundation |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217034527/http://monalisa.org/2012/09/11/prado/ |archivedate=17 December 2015 }}</ref>

The restored painting is from a slightly different perspective than the original ''Mona Lisa'', leading to the [[Speculations about Mona Lisa|speculation]] that it is part of the world's first [[stereoscopic]] pair.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carbon |first1=C.

===''Isleworth Mona Lisa''===
{{main|Isleworth Mona Lisa}}
A version of the ''Mona Lisa'' known as the ''[[Isleworth Mona Lisa]]'' and also known as the ''Earlier Mona Lisa'' was first bought by an English nobleman in 1778 and was rediscovered in 1913 by [[Hugh Blaker]], an art connoisseur. The painting was presented to the media in 2012 by the Mona Lisa Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/early-mona-lisa-unveiling-the-oneinamillion-identical-twin-to-leonardo-da-vinci-painting-9926951.html |title='Early Mona Lisa': Unveiling the one-in-a-million identical twin to Leonardo da Vinci painting |first=Kunal |last=Dutta |date=15 December 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216084610/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/early-mona-lisa-unveiling-the-oneinamillion-identical-twin-to-leonardo-da-vinci-painting-9926951.html |archivedate=16 December 2014 }}</ref>  It is a painting of the same subject as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa.
